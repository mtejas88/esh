High-Level Insights: No additional districts that aren't already scheduled to receive the survey need to receive it.


Supporting Evidence: 4200 districts (out of 12500) districts that need Wi-Fi clarification (didn't change response from '16-'17 or no response in '17) will receive the survey. The key demographic info (size, locale, cleanliness, starting budget) in the survey group is very close to matching the population. Additionally, when these demographic fields are broken out by the 3 wifi responses we care about (suff -> suff, insuff -> insuff, and no response in '17) the demogs also are very similar. As long as the responses are distributed across the different factors we care about, we should be good to go.

Methodology: Districts we want to survey are d17.needs_wifi = d16.needs_wifi or d17.needs_wifi is null. Note: at the district level

Disclaimers/Data Considerations:

Next Steps/Recommendations: Send survey as is and wait for results to examine if any fields can help us determine if we can adjust these districts wifi statuses
