High-Level Insights: There don't appear to be any trends in regards to locale, district size, or state.  

Supporting Evidence: T-tests were insignificant across the different buckets when separating out districts with 1Mbps/student vs the rest of the districts.

Methodology: 2017 District-level data subset to exclude_from_ia_analysis == FALSE. T-tests run comparing the subset of districts with bandwidth_per_student_kbps >= 1,000 vs all other districts.

Disclaimers/Data Considerations: TX is still 75% dirty, and I think there could be some potential trends as the majority of districts with greater than 1 Mbps BW in 2016 were in TX.

Next Steps/Recommendations: Re-run analysis after TX is cleaned. No later than August 4th.
