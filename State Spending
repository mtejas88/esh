Name of QAing Analyst(s): 
Purpose: To display all state snapshot metrics and QA metrics, with addition of state-level broadband spending
Methodology: Each metrics grouping begins with a comment. Any table that begins with "states" is calculating metrics at the state level, then 
all "states" queries are merged in the final query. There are 3 different groups of districts that are used -- universe (ie, clean and dirty); 
clean_goal_fiber (ie, clean), and clean_afford (ie, clean and has cost information).
