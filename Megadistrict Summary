Purpose: Summarizes each state's population of megadistricts (e.g. number, num_students, % of students, 
districts, and campuses represented, etc.)
Methodology: Grouping the "districts" table by state allows for the use of aggregate functions to
quantify the quantity and relative statistical influence of megadistricts within each state.
