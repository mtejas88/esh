Name of QAing Analyst(s):  
Purpose: To identify known/suspected consortia serving K-12 districts within the ESH population, returning 
relevant contact information and specifying the districts on whose behalf they procure 
Methodology: This query leverages the applicant-provided information housed in the 
"fy2015_basic_information_and_certifications" table to identify a list of relevant consortium applicants.  The 
exact criteria used to distinguish potential consortia from other entities include: whether the entity files as 
a "STATEWIDE" applicant, whether the applicant self-identifies as a public institution and/or a state agency, 
and whether the user indicates that the entity conducts aggregated procurement on behalf of schools.
