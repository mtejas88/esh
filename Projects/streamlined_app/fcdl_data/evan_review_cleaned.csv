The selected bid must itself be cost-effective compared to prices available commercially and stated that ""there may be situations where the price of services is so exorbitant that it cannot, on its face, be cost-effective.

77,78,"DR1:FCC rules require a competitive bidding process where an applicant chooses a service provider only after defining all of the specific services eligible for support at each eligible entity. Only by doing so can applicants ensure that they are receiving the most cost-effective services because bidders have sufficient information to determine exact bid prices. The goal of the competitive bidding process is to have as many bidders as possible respond to an FCC Form 470, RFP, or other solicitation method so that the applicant can receive better service and lower prices. One of the benefits of forming a consortium as it relates to the Schools and Libraries Program is to aggregate demand in order to lower prices and promote more efficient use of shared facilities. When asked to provide the competitive bid documentation for this FRN, no documentation was provided and you explained that â€œBecause Telephone Voice Service is handled individually by each school on a Month-To-Month basis, no bidding process was needed by the Consortium for this application and therefore, no single service provider was selected.â€œ Moreover, the RFP specified that Voice services were â€œNot subject to Bidding Considerations due to the fact that each individual school chooses their own service provider for Telecommunication Services on a MTM basis.â€ This is a violation because FCC rules require that in order to be eligible for E-rate support, all services and funding requests must be competitively bidded on in accordance with the programâ€™s competitive bid rules and regulations. Since you failed to demonstrate you met this requirement, this FRN must be denied.;DR2:FCC rules require a competitive bidding process where an applicant chooses a service provider only after defining all of the specific services eligible for support at each eligible entity. Applicants are required to provide bona fide requests for service, so that potential providers can provide accurate bids. The FCC elaborated on the meaning of â€œbona fideâ€ in the Universal Service Order, where it stated that Congress â€œintended to require accountability on the part of schools and libraries,â€ which should therefore be required to â€œ(1) conduct internal assessments of the components necessary to use effectively the discounted services they order; (2) submit complete description of services they seek so that it may be posted for competing providers to evaluate. Per the FCCâ€™s Ysleta Order, an applicantâ€™s FCC Form 470 must be based upon its current needs and must detail specific services sought. In this instance, you stated that the RFP posted with FY2016 FCC Forms 470 #160029101 â€œwas created years ago before any changes to free services occurred. The RFP was used merely as a guideline for the services required and any questions by prospective bidders were answered by Mr. MalavÃ©. The RFP was not used in any way to evaluate the prospective bidders in choosing the winning bid.â€ However, this document included specific instructions to prospective bidders that would be deemed essential for submitting an accurate proposal. As a stand alone solicitation, the referenced FCC Form 470 #160029101 failed to provide all pertinent information for prospective bidders to submit accurate and valid proposals. Because you failed to provide a bona fide request for services of your current needs and failed to make all pertinent information available to all potential bidders, service providers could not

106,107,"DR1:FCC rules require a competitive bidding process where an applicant chooses a service provider only after defining all of the specific services eligible for support at each eligible entity. Only by doing so can applicants ensure that they are receiving the most cost-effective services because bidders have sufficient information to determine exact bid prices. The goal of the competitive bidding process is to have as many bidders as possible respond to an FCC Form 470, RFP, or other solicitation method so that the applicant can receive better service and lower prices. One of the benefits of forming a consortium as it relates to the Schools and Libraries Program is to aggregate demand in order to lower prices and promote more efficient use of shared facilities. When asked to provide the competitive bid documentation for this FRN, no documentation was provided and you explained that â€œBecause Telephone Voice Service is handled individually by each school on a Month-To-Month basis, no bidding process was needed by the Consortium for this application and therefore, no single service provider was selected.â€œ Moreover, the RFP specified that Voice services were â€œNot subject to Bidding Considerations due to the fact that each individual school chooses their own service provider for Telecommunication Services on a MTM basis.â€ This is a violation because FCC rules require that in order to be eligible for E-rate support, all services and funding requests must be competitively bidded on in accordance with the programâ€™s competitive bid rules and regulations. Since you failed to demonstrate you met this requirement, this FRN must be denied.;DR2:FCC rules require a competitive bidding process where an applicant chooses a service provider only after defining all of the specific services eligible for support at each eligible entity. Applicants are required to provide bona fide requests for service, so that potential providers can provide accurate bids. The FCC elaborated on the meaning of â€œbona fideâ€ in the Universal Service Order, where it stated that Congress â€œintended to require accountability on the part of schools and libraries,â€ which should therefore be required to â€œ(1) conduct internal assessments of the components necessary to use effectively the discounted services they order; (2) submit complete description of services they seek so that it may be posted for competing providers to evaluate. Per the FCCâ€™s Ysleta Order, an applicantâ€™s FCC Form 470 must be based upon its current needs and must detail specific services sought. In this instance, you stated that the RFP posted with FY2016 FCC Forms 470 #160029101 â€œwas created years ago before any changes to free services occurred. The RFP was used merely as a guideline for the services required and any questions by prospective bidders were answered by Mr. MalavÃ©. The RFP was not used in any way to evaluate the prospective bidders in choosing the winning bid.â€ However, this document included specific instructions to prospective bidders that would be deemed essential for submitting an accurate proposal. As a stand alone solicitation, the referenced FCC Form 470 #160029101 failed to provide all pertinent information for prospective bidders to submit accurate and valid proposals. Because you failed to provide a bona fide request for services of your current needs and failed to make all pertinent information available to all potential bidders, service providers could not provide accurate bids and it was determined that you violated the FCCâ€™s requirements for a fair and open competitive bidding process, and funding is denied.",,Competitive Bidding Violation,dr1 fcc
