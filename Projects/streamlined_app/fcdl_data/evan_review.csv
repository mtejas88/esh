FCC rules state that in selecting a provider of eligible services, applicants must carefully consider all bids submitted and must select the most cost-effective service offering. In determining which service offering is the most cost-effective, entities may consider relevant factors other than the pre-discount prices submitted by providers, but price should be the primary factor considered. The FCC further codified in the Ysleta Order that in evaluating bids from prospective service providers, applicants must select the most cost-effective offering from the bids received. The selected bid must itself be cost-effective compared to prices available commercially and stated that ""there may be situations where the price of services is so exorbitant that it cannot, on its face, be cost-effective. For instance, a proposal to sell at prices two to three times greater than the prices available from commercial vendors would not be cost-effective, absent extenuating circumstances."" You selected a bid from Meetpoint for an amount of $3,200/month. The bid chosen is over two to three times more costly than a competing bid offering.
