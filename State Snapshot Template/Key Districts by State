    Nature of Modification: removed exclusionary rule that eliminated all districts except for those with
    "district_size"='Mega'
Name of QAing Analyst(s): Justine Schott
Purpose: Returns the three districts in each state that serve the greatest number of students within 
our population, and calculates summary statistics re: services procured.
Methodology: This query uses a self-join of the "districts" table to assign rankings to each district
within a state based on the number of students that they contain.
