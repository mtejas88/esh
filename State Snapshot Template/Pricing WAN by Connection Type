Name of QAing Analyst(s):  Justine Schott
Purpose: summarizes bundled Internet cost/mbps and WAN cost/connection on a circuit-level for each state, stratified by bandwidth range and by lit fiber vs. all conn. types
Methodology: 

min, 10th, 25th, median, 75th, 90th, max, mean, line item n, circuit n
for the most common bandwidth/connection type categories in each state
